numb
====

Number translator that takes digit strings and turns them into words.

Usage
-----

* Install `sbt`
* `sbt` to start the sbt console and then `run <number>` to invoke the translator.

Notes
-----

Currently, there is no method to build an exectuable jar, although one could be added simply with the sbt-assembly plugin and a little bit of time.
